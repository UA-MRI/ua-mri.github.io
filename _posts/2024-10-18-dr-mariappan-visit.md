We welcomed Dr. Mariappan Nadar, Senior Director of Research at Siemens Healthineers, to our campus this Friday as he received the ECE Distinguished Alumni award. After an engaging day of insightful conversations, we wrapped up the evening with a delightful dinner at Tumerico, a well-known and highly acclaimed restaurant in Tucson.
