## Research Interests
My research focuses on medical image analysis and deep learning, with an emphasis on quantitative MRI and CT. I develop methods for image reconstruction, segmentation, and contrast-phase classification across multiple imaging modalities. My current interests include T1/T2 mapping, noise-robust MRI reconstruction, abdominal CT phase recognition, radiomics, and deep learning approaches for automated liver analysis. I also work on brain imaging, particularly White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation and analyzing the relationship between vascular health and lesion burden.

## Background
I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey, and completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU). In 2023, I moved to Tucson, AZ to begin my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona.

## Personal
Outside of research, I love exploring new places and dancing bachata and salsa. I’m also an huge movie fan and run an Instagram blog where I share film recommendations and favorite picks.

## Extracurricular
I originally began my [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/dkarakay/) journey in Turkey and now continue in this role at the University of Arizona, where I support the local tech community through hackathons, open-source workshops, and student-focused talks. For the past two years, I have also served as president within the Turkish Student Association, organizing cultural events and community activities for students.
