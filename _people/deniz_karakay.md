I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona, where I work on MRI reconstruction, quantitative mapping, and neuroimaging analysis. My current projects include deep-learning–based T1/T2 reconstruction, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation, and studying microstructural changes around WMHs using diffusion MRI.
