## Research Interests

My research focus is on quantitative analysis of human subcortical brain structures, with a particular emphasis on the thalamus and its subnuclei.I primarily work with diffusion MRI to characterize microstructural organization and to develop data driven segmentation frameworks.In addition, I use population based modelling approaches on diffusion derived microstructural measures and thalamo cortical connectivity to characterize variability and structural differences across individuals.

## Background

I am originally from India and completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai. In 2021, I moved to the United States to pursue a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Arizona(UofA), where my academic training focused on machine learning and medical image analysis. Building on this foundation, I continued at the UofA to begin my Ph.D. in ECE, with my research centered on diffusion MRI based analysis of human subcortical region.

## Personal

Outside of research, I enjoy learning about history, watching movies, and experimenting with cooking new cuisines in my free time.
