## Research Interests

My main research in the lab involves MRI pulse sequence design, but I am broadly interested in imaging and signal/image processing. I currently work on diffusion weighted radial turbo spin echo (RADTSE) sequences.

## Background

I am from Tucson, Arizona. I am in the final semester of my undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona and have been with the group since January 2025. I am also enrolled in the ECE accelerated master's program and plan to continue with the lab throughout the rest of the master's program.

## Personal

Outside of school, I enjoy cycling, reading, and language learning (primarily Spanish and Russian).

## Extracurricular

I enjoy being active in my community and serving as a mentor to my peers. I currently serve as chair of the University of Arizona IEEE Student Branch as well as treasurer of the amateur radio club on campus. Additionally, I volunteer as a dog walker at the Humane Society of Southern Arizona.
